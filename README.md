# 🔥 BLERKZ
By: Meghan Sorensen

**Blerkz** is a no-frills block glider built around precision, not chaos. Same speed. Same rules. Three levels. If you crash, it’s not because the game changed — it’s because you did.

## 🧱 What It Is
You control a single block gliding forward through hostile space.  
Obstacles are placed on purpose. Every gap is survivable.  

There are **three handcrafted levels**, each demanding tighter movement and better control than the last.

No ramps. No RNG. No excuses.

## 🕹 Controls
- **⬅ Left Arrow** — Glide left  
- **➡ Right Arrow** — Glide right  

That’s it. Master it or restart.

## 🎯 How to Play
1. Launch **Blerkz**
2. Glide left and right to avoid obstacles
3. Clear all three levels
4. Crash → restart → try again
